# AGENTS.md

## Purpose and Scope

- This file defines mandatory operating rules for agents working in this repository.
- When tradeoffs conflict, prioritize skill contract clarity, changelog accuracy, and release safety.

## Core Release Policy

- Do not bump any skill version unless explicitly instructed by the user to prepare or cut a release.
- Until the user gives a release instruction, record notable changes only under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Do not pre-assign future release versions in `## [Unreleased]` entries. Describe the changed skill and behavior without guessing the eventual version.
- Maintain `CHANGELOG.md` with the Keep a Changelog workflow: keep an `Unreleased` section for in-progress changes, move those entries into a release section when cutting a release, and create a fresh empty `Unreleased` section for future changes.

## Release Procedure

- When the user instructs a release, review all accumulated `## [Unreleased]` entries and the corresponding implementation/doc changes before choosing versions.
- Determine the next version for each affected skill from the actual accumulated changes:
  - Major: incompatible workflow or contract changes.
  - Minor: new user-visible capability, workflow branch, or supported use case.
  - Patch: clarifications, narrow fixes, examples, or behavior-preserving corrections.
- Bump the `version` field in each affected skill's `SKILL.md` only during release preparation.
- Move the released changelog entries from `## [Unreleased]` to a section headed `## [<skill-name> <version>] - <YYYY-MM-DD>`, where the date is when that skill's `SKILL.md` version changed.
- Move repository-wide maintenance entries that are not attributable to one skill to `## [Repository] - <YYYY-MM-DD>`. Do not use repository sections for skill behavior changes.

## Change Coupling Rules

- Any skill behavior change must update the relevant `SKILL.md`, supporting references, README text, and `CHANGELOG.md` entry in the same change set when those artifacts describe the changed behavior.
- Do not defer sibling documentation updates when the current change invalidates existing text.

## Evaluation Workspace Rules

- Keep eval definitions under `evals/<skill-name>/`.
- Store generated eval run outputs under `evals/<skill-name>/workspace/`.
- Do not create generated eval workspaces next to skill packages under `skills/`.
- Do not commit generated eval workspaces unless the user explicitly asks for them; they are local artifacts covered by `.gitignore`.

## Commit Rules

- Use Conventional Commits.
- Keep commits logically scoped; do not mix unrelated changes.
- Do not force-add ignored files or otherwise commit files outside the agreed commit scope unless the user explicitly instructs you to include those extra files.
